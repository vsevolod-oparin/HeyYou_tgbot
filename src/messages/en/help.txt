<strong>Hello!</strong>

Hi, my name HeyYou bot. I'm a bot to query YouChat via telegram. You can talk to me in private and also get my service in the chat.

- In private chat, just talk to me.
- For public chat, use the command /heyyou. Or if admins set it up, you can just tag me in your query.

To get this message again, just use /help.

For chat admins. If you want to be served in the chat by /heyyou command, just add me to the chat. If you want to get my service by tagging, add me in the chat as an admin. I don't need any permission, so feel free to disable all of them.

<strong>Reliability disclaimer</strong>

The bot relies on an unofficial API. As we hope, that soon public API will be available, the up-time is not guaranteed at the moment.
Nevertheless, you can vote for the support of API from YouCom team: https://discord.com/channels/958041025539080202/1099742780563128452/1099742780563128452

The bot responses are generated by a complicated AI chat system.
Though there is a lot of ongoing work to improve the quality of the results and technology is actually marvelous,
checking the factual truthfulness of the response is still subject of user responsibility.
