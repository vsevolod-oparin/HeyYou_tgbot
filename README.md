# Unofficial YouChat telegram bot

Simple bot to support [YouChat](you.com) in Telegram.

## How to run

Install all python requirements into local venv.
```commandline
$> python -m venv venv
$> ./venv/bin/pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

Get the token for Telegram bot from [Telegram BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather) 
and API token from [unofficial YouChat API](https://api.betterapi.net/about/).

Put corresponding tokens into src/tokens/telegram and src/tokens/betterapi, respectively.

To run the bot, simply execute the code.
```commandline
$> ./venv/bin/python src/tgbot/main.py 
```

## Reliability disclaimer

The bot relies on unofficial API. As we hope, that soon public API will be available, the up-time is not guaranteed. 
Nevertheless, you can vote for the support of API from YouCom team: https://discord.com/channels/958041025539080202/1099742780563128452/1099742780563128452 

Also, the results are generated by a complicated AI chat system. 
Though there is a lot of ongoing work to improve the quality of the results and technology is actually marvelous, 
checking the factual truthfulness of the response is still subject of user responsibility.
